# [Programming 1](http://challenges.enigmagroup.org/programming/1/)

This just requires we code a POST request to this endpoint. We could use Ruby
or we can just craft a cURL request. What constitutes programming? Shell scripting 
is better suited for something so minimal.


`curl 'http://challenges.enigmagroup.org/programming/1/' -X POST  -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=94xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx17ok6;mission=yes' -d "ip=74.XXX.XXX.XX&username=shoes52`

Mission completed!
