Login page with a dropdown and submit and instructions to "login as jane" but
there is no jane in the dropdown.

I can think of a few ways to do this. This is labeled as a Javascript mission but
I think I'm just going to modify the POST request to submit "Jane" instead of "Jack"

And voila we passed!
