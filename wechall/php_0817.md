So this is similar to the other LFI but how can we pass a valid `which` (ie. 0,1,2) and 
pass our `solution` to be actually included.

`?which=solution`

Well because the PHP `switch` statement is comparing our input to a number so it tries 
to coerce the string into a number and according to the [docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.conversion) 
if its not a valid numeric it will always be "0". So we can pass whatever file name 
we want and it will always get included.


Solved.
