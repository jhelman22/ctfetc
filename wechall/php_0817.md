So this is similar to the other LFI but how can we pass a valid `which` (ie. 0,1,2) and 
pass our `solution` to be actually included. Well we can pass the parameter twice!

`?which=0&which=solution`

I'm still doing research on why this works and will probably set up my own LAMP stack 
to experiment with it. My guess is that `$_GET["which"]` iterates through values if 
there are more than one.

Solved.
