# [Vigenere Cipher](https://ctflearn.com/problems/305)

As the title says this a Vigenere Cipher where they have given you the key and the ciphertext.

You should read how Vigenere Cipher's work and code your own solution. I, however, already did 
that for overthewire/krypton so I'm just going to use [this decoder](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher)

And there's our flag!
