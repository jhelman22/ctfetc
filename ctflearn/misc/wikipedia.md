**Difficulty: Easy**

Now, I have to admit this was pretty clever. All it gives us as hints is: Wikipedia and an 
IP address.

Well if we go to Wikipedia and search for that IP address, we see an old revision(ie. edit) 
of the "Flags" wiki page.

We check out the diff and there was a section added for flags and their use in competitions.

Like I said, this was pretty clever.
