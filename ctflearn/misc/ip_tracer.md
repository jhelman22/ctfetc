# [IP Tracer](https://ctflearn.com/problems/686)

**Difficulty: Easy**

We need to find where the IP address 159.167.16.5 is located in the world.

I first just tried:  
`whois 159.167.16.5`

This returned "Warwick" as the city but that apparently was incorrect.

So I found an [online tool](https://www.iplocation.net/)

It returned Warwick as well but also returned London.

And that was the flag!

> London
