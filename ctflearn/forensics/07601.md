So we got a PNG. Probably some more steganography. Let's try the obvious stuff.

`strings AGT.png | grep ABC`

Well that was easy... there's the flag!

Wait... That apparently isn't the flag. Just a decoy. Damn...

Nothing in EXIF either.

Hmmm when I try to open it in Gimp. I get an error

> Corrupt JPEG data: 11 extraneous bytes before marker 0xd9

Looks like something is there that shouldn't be there!

`binwalk AGT.png`

Yep there's a bunch of zip files in there...

`binwalk -D=".*" AGT.png`

If we look in that directory, there is our JPEG and 3 zip files that have contents. Let's 
look in each one.

We can follow the directories all the way down to another corrupted JPEG that appears the same 
for each zip file.

`strings 'I Warned You.jpeg' | grep ABC`

There that has to be the flag! No more decoys please!
