# Picobrowser

"This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21851/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21851"

We try to view the flag and get an error that says "...you are not picobrowser" and then it displays our User Agent.

So let's spoof our User Agent by modifying the headers of the request.
