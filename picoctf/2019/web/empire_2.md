# Empire 2

"Well done, Agent 513! Our sources say Evil Empire Co is passing secrets around when you log in: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/16415/ (link), can you help us find it? or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:16415"

Same website as the first "Empire" challenge. Let's create a user again.

Same setup: Add Todos, Your Todos, and an employee directory.

Last challenge had a SQLi vulnerability in the add todos form.

Unfortunately our old concatenation trick doesn't work.
