# The Numbers

"The numbers... what do they mean?"

We got a picture with some numbers. They are all numbers except the curly braces.

Looks like the flag has just been encoded somehow.

The first number is 16, and knowing our flag starts with 'p'.

'p' is the 16th letter of the alphabet. So let's run with that. Here's all the numbers:

"16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }"

The only thing we don't know is capitalization. The hint tells us that it's in all caps.
