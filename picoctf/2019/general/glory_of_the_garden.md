# Glory of the Garden

"This garden contains more than it seems. You can also find the file in /problems/glory-of-the-garden_1_2e13eb26e18a569a71cc32f9d51ccb4e on the shell server."

We got a jpg file. The first thought is obviously to look at the picture.

Just a picture of a garden path. Maybe there is something "hidden" in the file.

`strings garden.jpg | grep pico`

Found it!
