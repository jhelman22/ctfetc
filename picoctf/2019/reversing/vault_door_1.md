# Vault Door 1

"This vault uses some complicated arrays! I hope you can make sense of it, special agent. The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor1.java"

Looking at the source code and particularly the `checkPassword()` function.

We see that it is just checking each of the 32 characters for a specific character. Just have to unscramble them for the password.
