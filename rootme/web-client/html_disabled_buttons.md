# [HTML Disabled Buttons](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Client/HTML-disabled-buttons)

We got a form where the input and button has been disabled.

If we inspect the form in source, we see they are just using the `disabled` html attribute.

We can delete those in dev tools so that we can type `admin` into the text input and click 
the button.
