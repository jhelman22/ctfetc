# [Weak Password](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Web-Server/Weak-password)

We get a login prompt. The challenge is called "Weak Password" so no joke, my first 
attempt was "admin:admin" and I got in. You probably could have brute forced this with 
a really short list of common passwords but I got lucky.

Password is **admin**
